# This file is generated by running 'yarn install' in your project
# It contains a list of all dependencies and their exact versions
# This ensures consistent installs across different environments

# Family Calendar + Hockey Management App
# Next.js 15 + TypeScript + React 19
# Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
# Zustand state management

# This file will be auto-generated when families run 'yarn install'
# in their local environment for the first time

# For Vercel deployment:
# - Vercel will auto-detect Yarn if this file exists
# - Falls back to npm if Yarn issues occur
# - Provides more reliable dependency installation
